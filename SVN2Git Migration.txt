Migrate SVN to Git with history

Follow: http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/08/migrating-from-subversion-to-git-with.html

1. Install Ruby, git and github(client)
2. Install svn2git.gem by executing "gem install svn2git" from <path to ruby>/bin
	If fails then download svn2git.gem into <path to ruby> then execute 
		>cd <path to ruby>
		>bin\gem install svn2git.gem
		
3. Backup your code from SVN into some location.
4. Create a new folder then Migrate your subversion repository in to the folder
	svn2git http://[domain name]/svn/[repository root]
	If you get the following error
		command failed:
		git checkout –f master
		
		Then follow: https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git
		Example: if you have no trunk, branch,tag in your SVN repository then
			use 
			$ svn2git svn://localhost/CustomizedUjanLearningAndroid --rootistrunk
			
5. Push your code to Git
	a. git remote add origin https://github.com/ashismo/LearningABCD
	b. Just as a sanity check, I’ll give it a bit of “git remote –v” to confirm it’s completed successfully:
	c. git push –-all
	
	If the following error comes then use "git push --force" and once done don't forget to execute "git config --global push.default matching"
	F:\ashish.mondal\myGithub\svnToGitLatest>git push --all
	Username for 'https://github.com': ashismo
	Password for 'https://ashismo@github.com':
	To https://github.com/ashismo/LearningABCD.git
	! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
	error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/ashismo/LearningABCD.git'

	hint: Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote
	hint: counterpart. Check out this branch and integrate the remote changes
	hint: (e.g. 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
	hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
